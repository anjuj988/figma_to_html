    "# Advanced RAG Techniques for Invoice Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Template-Based RAG\n",
    "**Purpose**: Pattern matching specialized for invoice formats\n",
    "- Uses predefined regex patterns to identify bill numbers based on common formats\n",
    "- More reliable than generic text extraction\n",
    "- Handles variations in invoice number formats\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages**:\n",
    "- Higher accuracy for standard invoice formats\n",
    "- Reduces false positives\n",
    "- Can handle multiple document styles\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Zone-Based RAG (Hierarchical)\n",
    "**Purpose**: Divides document into logical sections for targeted processing\n",
    "- Header (top 20%): Usually contains key invoice details\n",
    "- Body (middle 60%): Contains line items, descriptions\n",
    "- Footer (last 20%): Contains totals, additional info\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages**:\n",
    "- Prioritizes areas where invoice numbers typically appear\n",
    "- Reduces processing time\n",
    "- Improves accuracy by focusing on relevant sections\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Context-Aware RAG with Format Validation\n",
    "**Purpose**: Validates extracted numbers using surrounding context\n",
    "- Checks for nearby keywords (\"Invoice No.\", \"Bill #\", etc.)\n",
    "- Validates format against known patterns\n",
    "- Scores candidates based on multiple criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages**:\n",
    "- Higher accuracy through contextual understanding\n",
    "- Reduces incorrect extractions\n",
    "- Better handling of complex formats\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Ensemble RAG Approach\n",
    "**Purpose**: Combines multiple extraction methods\n",
    "- Uses weighted voting from different techniques\n",
    "- Integrates results from all approaches\n",
    "- Provides confidence scores for extracted values\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages**:\n",
    "- More robust than single method\n",
    "- Better handling of edge cases\n",
    "- Higher overall accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Format Validation:\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "1. Length checks (typically 6-12 characters)\n",
    "2. Character composition (mix of letters/numbers)\n",
    "3. Special character handling (-/.)\n",
    "4. Case sensitivity preservation\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Context Rules:\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "1. Look for prefix indicators (Invoice, Bill, No., etc.)\n",
    "2. Check nearby date formats\n",
    "3. Verify position in document\n",
    "4. Consider document structure\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Processing Flow:\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "1. Initial OCR text extraction\n",
    "2. Zone-based document splitting\n",
    "3. Template matching within zones\n",
    "4. Context validation\n",
    "5. Format validation\n",
    "6. Ensemble scoring\n",
    "7. Final selection\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Issues Solved:\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "1. Prefix removal (INV, BILL, etc.)\n",
    "2. Format preservation (when needed)\n",
    "3. Special character handling\n",
    "4. Case sensitivity\n",
    "5. Context verification\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices:\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "1. Always validate against multiple patterns\n",
    "2. Consider document structure\n",
    "3. Use weighted scoring\n",
    "4. Preserve original format when needed\n",
    "5. Implement confidence thresholds\n",
    "6. Log and track extraction patterns\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Performance Tips:\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "1. Cache common patterns\n",
    "2. Implement early stopping\n",
    "3. Use parallel processing for large batches\n",
    "4. Maintain pattern databases\n",
    "5. Regular expression optimization\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This structured approach should significantly improve your bill number extraction accuracy while maintaining good performance for other fields. The key is to implement these features incrementally and test thoroughly with your specific document types."
